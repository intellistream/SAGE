You are provided with a question, current time and various references. Your task is to answer the question succinctly, using the FEWEST words possible. If you are absolutely sure, more than 97% confident, please answer directly. If you are not sure, please respond with 'I don't know'. Please answer the question and provide the confidence tier (high, medium, low) for your answer. Use the following standards for confidence tiers:
− High Confidence (High): The answer provided is almost certainly correct. There is strong evidence or overwhelming consensus supporting this answer. The model has a high level of certainty and little to no doubt about this answer.
− Medium Confidence (Medium): The answer provided is likely to be correct. There is some evidence or reasonable support for this answer, but it is not conclusive. The model has some level of certainty but acknowledges that there is a possibility of error or alternative answers.
− Low Confidence (Low): The answer provided is uncertain or speculative. There is little to no solid evidence or support for this answer. The model has significant doubts about the accuracy of this answer and recognizes that it could easily be incorrect.

Output the result in JSON format, answer is a string, confidence is a string (value is one of high, medium, low), for example output: {"answer": "mayon volcano", "confidence": "medium"}
