# SAGE Queue CMake Migration Summary

## What Was Changed

### 1. Directory Structure Reorganization
- **Headers**: Moved to `include/` directory
  - `ring_buffer.h` → `include/ring_buffer.h`
  - `concurrentqueue.h` → `include/concurrentqueue.h`  
  - `lightweightsemaphore.h` → `include/lightweightsemaphore.h`

- **Sources**: Moved to `src/` directory
  - `ring_buffer.cpp` → `src/ring_buffer.cpp`

- **Python Files**: Moved to `python/` directory
  - `sage_queue.py` → `python/sage_queue.py`
  - `sage_queue_manager.py` → `python/sage_queue_manager.py`
  - `sage_demo.py` → `python/sage_demo.py`
  - `debug_queue.py` → `python/debug_queue.py`
  - `cleanup.py` → `python/cleanup.py`

- **New Directories Added**:
  - `bindings/` - Python bindings with pybind11
  - `tests/` - Test files
  - `build/` - CMake build output

### 2. CMake Build System
- Created `CMakeLists.txt` with full CMake configuration
- Supports debug/release builds, OpenMP, testing
- Maintains compatibility with existing build interface
- Includes installation and packaging support

### 3. Build Scripts
- **Unified**: `build.sh` - Now uses CMake directly (consistent with `sage_db`)
- **Updated**: `auto_compile.sh` - Now uses the unified `build.sh`
- **Removed**: `build_cmake.sh` - No longer needed, functionality integrated into `build.sh`

### 4. Build Options
- Release/Debug builds with proper optimization
- AddressSanitizer support for debug builds
- OpenMP support for multithreading
- Automatic testing with CTest
- Python bindings support (future extensibility)

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Now matches `sage_db` project structure and build system exactly
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of headers, sources, and Python code
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add tests, documentation, and Python bindings
4. **Standards Compliance**: Follows CMake best practices
5. **Unified Interface**: Single `build.sh` script like other `sage_ext` components

## Testing

The build system has been tested and works correctly:
- ✅ Release builds
- ✅ Debug builds with AddressSanitizer
- ✅ Basic testing with CTest
- ✅ Compatibility symlinks maintained
- ✅ Integration with existing installation system

## Integration

The changes are fully integrated with the SAGE installation system:
- `install.py` continues to work unchanged (scans for `build.sh` scripts)
- Docker builds supported
- CI/CD compatibility maintained
- All existing Python import paths preserved
