"""Context compression - MIGRATED to isage-refiner.

All context compression algorithms have been migrated to the independent package:

    pip install isage-refiner

Usage:
    from sage_refiner import LongRefiner, REFORMCompressor, ProvenceCompressor

For SAGE middleware integration:
    from sage.middleware.components.sage_refiner import RefinerService

This module is kept as a placeholder for backwards compatibility documentation.
No functionality remains here - use isage-refiner directly.
