"""
SAGE Agentic Workflow Optimizer Framework

Layer: L3 (Core - Research & Algorithm Library)

This module provides a standardized framework for researching and developing
optimization strategies for agentic workflows. It enables students and researchers
to experiment with different optimization approaches in a consistent environment.

Architecture:
    - Base abstractions for workflow representation
    - Pluggable optimizer interface
    - Evaluation metrics and benchmarking tools
    - Example optimizers for reference

Usage Example:
    >>> from sage.libs.workflow import WorkflowGraph, BaseOptimizer
    >>> from sage.libs.workflow.optimizers import GreedyOptimizer
    >>> 
    >>> # Define your workflow
    >>> workflow = WorkflowGraph()
    >>> workflow.add_agent("analyzer", cost=10, quality=0.8)
    >>> workflow.add_agent("generator", cost=20, quality=0.9)
    >>> workflow.add_dependency("analyzer", "generator")
    >>> 
    >>> # Apply optimizer
    >>> optimizer = GreedyOptimizer()
    >>> optimized = optimizer.optimize(workflow, constraints={"max_cost": 50})
    >>> 
    >>> # Evaluate results
    >>> metrics = optimizer.evaluate(workflow, optimized)
    >>> print(f"Cost reduction: {metrics.cost_reduction}%")
