"""
SAGE Unlearning Library
========================

A modular framework for machine unlearning in RAG systems with differential privacy guarantees.

Core Modules:
- dp_unlearning: Differential privacy mechanisms for selective unlearning
- algorithms: Various unlearning algorithms (Laplace, Gaussian, etc.)
- evaluation: Metrics and benchmarking tools
- benchmarks: Standard datasets and evaluation protocols

Research Extensions:
Students can extend this library by:
1. Implementing new privacy mechanisms
2. Designing novel perturbation strategies
3. Developing adaptive budget allocation algorithms
4. Creating domain-specific unlearning methods
