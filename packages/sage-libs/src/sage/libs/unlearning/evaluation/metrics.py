Evaluation Metrics for Unlearning
==================================

Implements metrics to evaluate unlearning quality.

**STUDENT RESEARCH POINT**: Design better metrics!

Key questions:
1. How do we measure "completeness" of unlearning?
2. How do we quantify utility degradation on retained data?
3. How do we balance privacy and utility?

    Metrics for evaluating machine unlearning.

    **STUDENT TODO**: Implement comprehensive evaluation metrics!

    Research goals:
    - Design metrics that capture real-world unlearning requirements
    - Develop automated testing for verification
    - Create benchmarks for comparing algorithms

        Measure how often forgotten vectors still appear in top-k results.

        **STUDENT RESEARCH POINT**: This is a key metric!

        Residual Recall Rate (RRR): Probability that a forgotten vector
        appears in top-k retrieval results.

        Goal: RRR should be close to 0 after unlearning.

        Args:
            forgotten_vectors: Vectors that should have been forgotten
            database_vectors: Current vectors in database (after unlearning)
            query_vector: Query to test retrieval
            k: Number of top results to check

        Returns:
            Fraction of forgotten vectors in top-k (lower is better)

        Research Ideas:
            - Test with multiple queries
            - Weight by similarity scores
            - Measure expected rank of forgotten items

        """
        Measure how much retained data performance degrades.

        **STUDENT RESEARCH POINT**: Critical for utility measurement!

        Retention Stability (RS): How well we preserve retrieval quality
        on data that should NOT be forgotten.

        Goal: RS should be close to 1 (no degradation).

        Args:
            retained_vectors_before: Retained vectors before unlearning
            retained_vectors_after: Retained vectors after unlearning (compensated)

            k: Number of top results

        Returns:
            Similarity between before/after rankings (higher is better)

        Research Ideas:
            - Use ranking correlation metrics (Kendall's tau, NDCG)
            - Measure retrieval precision/recall
            - Test on task-specific metrics (QA accuracy, etc.)

        Compute privacy-utility trade-off metrics.

        **STUDENT RESEARCH POINT**: Characterize the Pareto frontier!

        Goal: Find the optimal balance between privacy and utility.

            epsilon: Privacy parameter
            delta: Failure probability
            utility_metric: Measure of utility (e.g., accuracy, F1, NDCG)

            - Plot privacy-utility curves

TODO for Students - Evaluation Framework:
-----------------------------------------

1. **Comprehensive Metrics Suite** (Medium difficulty):
   Implement all standard unlearning metrics:

   class ComprehensiveMetrics:
       def compute_all_metrics(self, ...):
           return {
               'residual_recall_rate': self.rrr(...),
               'retention_stability': self.rs(...),
               'membership_inference_advantage': self.mia(...),
               'privacy_loss_empirical': self.privacy_loss(...),
               'utility_accuracy': self.utility(...),
           }

2. **Verification Tests** (Hard difficulty):
   Implement automated verification that unlearning succeeded:

   - Membership inference attacks (verify non-membership)
   - Model inversion attacks (verify no reconstruction)
   - Statistical tests (verify distribution changed)

   class UnlearningVerifier:
       def verify_unlearning(self, model_before, model_after, forgotten_data):
           # Run membership inference attack
           # Run reconstruction attack
           # Perform statistical tests
           pass

3. **Benchmark Suite** (Research-level):
   Create standardized benchmarks for comparing algorithms:

   class UnlearningBenchmark:
       def __init__(self, dataset, unlearning_algorithm):
           self.dataset = dataset
           self.algorithm = unlearning_algorithm

       def run_benchmark(self):
           # Test on multiple forget scenarios
           # Measure privacy, utility, efficiency
           # Generate comparison plots
           pass
