This test file is temporarily skipped due to Flag-Day refactor.

The new UnifiedInferenceClient in sage-llm-core is minimal and doesn't include:
- InferenceResult class
- UnifiedClientConfig class
- UnifiedClientMode class

These tests need to be rewritten for the new simple API or moved elsewhere.
