ERROR: Cannot install numpy==2.2.6 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested numpy==2.2.6
    The user requested (constraint) numpy==2.2.6,>=1.21.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
