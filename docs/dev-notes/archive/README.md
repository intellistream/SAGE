## Why Archive?

These files are kept in the archive because:
1. They document important historical refactoring work
2. They may be useful for understanding past architectural decisions
3. They can serve as templates for future similar refactoring tasks

## Note

These scripts should NOT be run on the current codebase without careful review, as the code structure may have evolved since they were created.
